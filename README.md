# Langston's Ant
This Langton's Ant simulation allows the player to choose the parameters of the board and ant.

To learn more about the Langston's Ant simulation, visit the ![wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant).

## Usage
The main menu allows the player to choose to play the game or quit.

If the player decides to play, they may select the number of rows and columns for the board, the start row, column, and direction for the ant, and the total number of steps.

Once the parameters are chosen, the player hits "Enter" to make the ant move until the steps are exhausted. The row, column, orientation, and remaining steps are tracked during each iteration.

When the simulation is complete, the player is returned to the main menu.

## Deployment
To deploy and play, please use the makefile.
